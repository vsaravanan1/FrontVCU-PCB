# FrontVCU-PCB
**Front Vehicle Control Unit PCB for Solar Gators**\
• High-reliability control PCB for a solar-powered racecar that manages 12V vehicle subsystems (front
lights, headlights, driver fan, horn)\
• Managed 12V vehicle loads using smart high-side switch drivers interfaced with an STM32U575RG microcontroller;
selected high-side architecture to improve protection against short-to-ground faults\
• Implemented USB-C Power Delivery circuitry for bench-testing 12V loads using standard laptop chargers.\
• Designed a robust power management architecture including buck converters, power multiplexers, E-Fuses, I2C
current sensors, and reverse polarity protection using power MOSFETs.\
• Implemented real-time status updates using CAN FD Transceivers, resulting in significant advantages over
traditional CAN architectures, including an 8x increase in payload size and a 5x increase in data rate.
